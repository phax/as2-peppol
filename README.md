# as2-peppol-client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phax/as2-peppol-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phax/as2-peppol-client)
ï»¿
An example AS2 client to easily send AS2 messages to PEPPOL.
This AS2 client is based on my **[as2-lib](https://github.com/phax/as2-lib)** library.

When you are looking for a PEPPOL AS2 server component you may have a look at my **[as2-peppol-server](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-server)** project.

Please have a look at the [PEPPOL practical AP guide](http://peppol.helger.com/public/?menuitem=docs-setup-ap)
for a detailed description on how it works and how it fits in the overall PEPPOL transport infrastructure.

This project is licensed under the Apache 2 License.

# Configuration

A keystore in the format JKS or PKCS12 must be available that must contain your Peppol AP certificate.

See https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons#peppol-smp-client for the list of configuration items of the Peppol SMP client.


# Sending a document

A test class is `src/test/java/.../MainAS2TestClient` and you need to adopt the variables according to your needs to make it work.

Before being ready to send a document, the recipient participant identifier as well as the test document must be selected. This happens currently directly in the `main` method and you have to choose the recipient you want.

The test files reside in the `src/main/resources/xml` folder and are referenced via classpath relative lookups.

## Usage of a proxy server

To use a proxy server, add the following items to the `smp-client.properties` configuration file (of course with adopted values):
 
```
http.proxyHost=1.2.3.4
http.proxyPort=8080
https.proxyHost=1.2.3.4
https.proxyPort=8080
```


# Maven usage
Add the following to your `pom.xml` to use this artifact:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
  <artifactId>as2-peppol-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The binary version of this library can be found on http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/com/helger/as2-peppol-client/ 
It depends on several other libraries so I suggest you are going for the Maven source integration.
